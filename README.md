# Least-common-multiple-and-greatest-common-factor
Repository containing a Python program that calculates least common multiple and greatest common factor of two numbers as well as READEME file.

lcmAndGcf2.py is a project for my computer science class. Besides finding the lmc and gcf of given numbers, the program also finds and displays:
1. all factors of both numbers
2. factors they share
3. all multiples of both numbers as long as they are not greater than both numbers multiplied together
4. multiples they share
The program uses a while loop to initialize essential variables and lists and prompts the user if they want to perform another calculation. If the answer is yes, the loop starts over.

VERY IMPORTANT!
The program is written to be only compatible with use of integers. Any other input will result in value error.
The while loop will start over only if the user will type lower y letter. Any other input will triger the goodbye message and stop the program from running.
